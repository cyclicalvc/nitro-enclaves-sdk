# Nitro Security Module Interface for Go

This is an implementation of the [AWS Nitro Security Module][nsm] interface for
Go. Nitro Enclaves only support Linux OSs on X86 or X64, so this package is not
intended to be used on other OSs or architectures.

This has been forked to remove potential supply chain attacks.
